# Managing an Ada AI Agent with adacli

`adacli` wraps Ada's management dashboard API. Invocation is always:

```
adacli <instance> <command> [subcommand] [options]
```

`<instance>` is a bare handle (`gennie`), a full domain (`bot.us2.ada.support`), or a URL.

## Always do first

1. **Confirm the instance** with the user if ambiguous — every command targets one.
2. **Check the session**: `adacli <instance> status --json`. If not connected, tell the
   user to run `adacli <instance> login` (it may need interactive email/password/MFA).
3. **Prefer `--json`** for every read so you can parse with `jq`. Output is JSON on
   stdout; errors are a JSON envelope on stderr; the **typed exit code** reflects the failure
   class: `0` ok, `2` usage, `3` auth, `4` forbidden, `5` not-found, `6` rate-limit, `7` read-only,
   `8` network, `9` conflict, `20` walk-partial, `21` walk-empty, `22` audit-degraded. Branch on it to
   self-correct (e.g. `3` → log in; `6` → back off). For the walk codes (`20`/`21`), the
   capped-vs-partial rule, and the exit-22 degraded-read rule, see **Exit-code semantics**
   under Conventions below.
4. **Discover the whole surface** with `adacli <instance> agent-context` — a machine-readable
   dump of every command, flag, exit code, and the error contract. Read it once instead of
   scraping `--help`.

## Load the full reference

This skill is the entrypoint. For the complete command-by-command guide, run and read:

```bash
adacli <instance> docs claude-code
```

Do that once at the start of an Ada session, then keep using the commands below.

## Most-used commands

```bash
adacli <instance> client --json                       # instance info / persona
adacli <instance> knowledge list --json               # knowledge base
adacli <instance> playbooks list --json               # playbooks
adacli <instance> guidance list --json                # custom instructions
adacli <instance> conversations search --all --limit 500 --json  # find conversations (see --all note below)
adacli <instance> analytics summary --json            # ClickHouse volume, resolution, and CSAT
adacli <instance> snapshot export -o config.json      # full config snapshot
```

## Conventions that make you effective

- **Playbook SDK starts.** Read the `playbooks update <id>` section of `adacli <instance> docs guide` for SDK start options and prerequisites.
- **Ask quick replies and image cards.** Before you author them, read the `ask` section of `adacli <instance> playbooks steps-schema`. On an ask with `inputs`, put the data source and card fields on the input, not on the step; the API rejects them on the step. After the write, check the `source:` and `card:` lines under the ask in `playbooks get <id>`.
- **Exit-code semantics (canonical note).** Read `.capped`/`.partial` from `--json`
  (or the table footer), not the exit code, to tell a bounded cohort from a truncated one.
  - A `--limit` (or default) **cap** is not a failure: it sets `capped: true` and exits `0`.
    This covers `search --all --limit`, `recent` (40-row default), and `export --limit`.
  - Only a **read-failure- or safety-limit-truncated (partial) walk** exits `20`
    (walk-partial): it sets `partial: true` and the emitted rows are usable but incomplete.
  - `export` adds file outcomes. A zero-row export writes nothing and exits `21` (walk-empty).
    `export` caps rows by default (50,000 to a file, 10,000 to stdout); pass `--limit <n>` to
    raise the file cap, and read `capped` from `--json` to tell a capped run from a complete one.
    For `export -o <file>`: a clean walk OR a cap (default or `--limit`) writes `<file>` and exits `0`.
    A complete export also clears a stale `<file>.partial`. A capped export leaves any prior
    `<file>.partial` alone. Only a partial (read-failure or safety-limit) walk writes `<file>.partial`
    and exits `20`, leaving `<file>` untouched. A capped `export` to stdout exits `0`.
    For transcript/reasoning export limits, read the Conversations section of
    `adacli <instance> docs claude-code` (canonical export concurrency note).
  - **Exit `22` (audit-degraded — canonical exit-22 note):** the read came back empty with
    no liveness signal after a retry — a degraded read, not a real empty result. Retry it;
    do not treat the empty result as a finding or author a fix on it. Emitters:
    `conversations diagnose`, `testing cases from-conversation`, and the single-id readers
    `conversations reasoning`, `transcript`, `log`, `details`, `handoffs`, and `guidance`.
  - **`analytics summary`, `analytics topics` and `conversations handoff-reasons` are NOT degraded-read-guarded.** The
    ClickHouse backend returns the same zeroed payload for a real quiet window and for its
    own read failure, so a zero from them is not verified — corroborate it before acting.
- **The JSON `total` of `conversations search`, `recent` and `export` is the full match count**
  (canonical total note). It is the full count in every mode, also on a capped walk. Read the
  rows returned from `conversations.length`. If the count read fails, `total` is `null` and a
  stderr note says so.
- **Paginate `conversations search` with `--all`; `conversations export` always walks the
  window — bound it with `--limit <n>`** (canonical `--all` note). `export` registers no
  `--all` flag. A bare `search` returns only the first page (30 rows). The JSON `total` of
  `search` and `export` follows the canonical total note. `--all` auto-paginates the whole window; pair it with `--limit <n>` to bound the walk (see Exit-code semantics above
  for how a cap vs a partial walk is reported). List commands (`knowledge list`, etc.) page with
  `--page` plus `--limit` (e.g. `knowledge list --page 2 --limit 25`); `changesets list`,
  `improve list`, and `improve queue list` page with `--cursor`.
- **`conversations recent` shows the 40 newest by default** (canonical recent note). Widen it
  with `--limit <n>`. It walks pages like `--all`, so the default 40-row cap (or a `--limit`
  cap) sets `capped: true` and exits `0` (see Exit-code semantics above). Its JSON `total`
  follows the canonical total note.
- **To fix one bad turn when you don't know which setting should change**, use
  `refinements`: pick the turn with `refinements turns`, stage a change with `refinements create`,
  check it with `refinements validate`, then `refinements save` or `refinements discard` it. Before
  the first call, read the Conversation Refinements section of `adacli <instance> docs claude-code`
  for the flow and how to act on each refusal code.
- **Read before you write.** `get`/`list` the resource first; show the user the diff
  you intend before `create`/`update`/`delete`.
- **Destructive ops** (`delete`, `snapshot import --mode replace`) need confirmation;
  pass `--confirm`/`--force` only after the user agrees.
- **Read-only instances**: production-like instances may be marked read_only in
  `~/.adacli/config`; writes will be refused with a clear error — don't fight it.
- **Pipe to jq** for big lists: `adacli <instance> knowledge list --json | jq '.articles[].title'`.

## Specialized workflows (separate skills)

- **Improve the agent autonomously (the main event)** → **ada-optimize** — example → diagnosis → fix → re-test → hill-climb
- Find what the agent gets wrong (incl. `conversations diagnose`) → **ada-insights**
- Knowledge base at scale → **ada-knowledge**
- Author + run tests, compare runs → **ada-test-agent**
- Version-control / promote / roll back a config → **ada-config-snapshot**
